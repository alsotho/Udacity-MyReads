# Udacity's FEND MyReads Project

In the MyReads project, you'll create a bookshelf app that allows you to select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read. The project emphasizes using React to build the application and provides an API server and client library that you will use to persist information as you interact with the application.

It contains three shelves, on which users can organize their books:
* Currently Reading
* Want To Read
* Read

In the right bottom corner, is a "+". A search page that has text input that may be used to find books. As the value of the text input changes, the books that match that query are displayed on the page, along with a control that lets users add the book to their library.

## Instructions

To use the application you should:

* clone the repository 
* change the directory to this project
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
